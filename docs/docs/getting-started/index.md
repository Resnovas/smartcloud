Welcome to the Smartcloud github actions project. This projects is built to work as an universal tool for Github Project management. Designed for simplicity and unity across our entire workflow to reduce repetitive tasks done through github actions. Through the use of declaritive tools, we are able to ensure simplistic approach to project management on Github. 

We designed this tool because the community tools either didn't have the features we wanted, or are not maintained. We wanted to create a single action which could do everything, or nothing, dependent on the configuration. This tool does exactly that, you choose how much or how little you want it to do...

Need reasons to consider using Smartcloud?

- Configured in a `config` JSON or YAML file found within your `.github` folder for the repository. One file = no clutter.

- Actively maintained - This project is actively maintained as it's the backbone of all our projects 
- Works on github actions - simply use a Personal Access Token with access to the repository or the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`
