## Why not GitHub Issues? {#why-not-github-issues}

GitHub is our office, it's the place where our development and contributor teams do their work. We use the issue list to keep track of bugs and the features that we are working on. We do this openly for transparency, to reduce replication by contributors and increase productivity.

With the discussion page, you can leverage the knowledge of our wider community to get help with any problems you are having. Please keep in mind that this project is open-source, support is provided by the goodwill of our wonderful community members.
