<!-- Thank you for concidering to create a pull request for this project.

We use Conventional Commits to title our pull requests. Please follow the [specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification)

To help you out heres some quick notes:

- fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug (this correlates with PATCH versioning).
- feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature (this correlates with MINOR versioning)
- <type>: other than fix: and feat: are allowed (this correlates with PRERELEASE versioning)
- [scope]: defines which package is being affected. 
- valid scopes are; smartcloudjs, cli, discord, workflows, components, webfront, console, webdocs
- Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix, or as an entry in the footer (correlating with MAJOR versioning).
- If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description
- If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the :

It is important to ensure that the title is formatted correctly as it's used by multiple automation systems. This includes Changelog Creation, Version Bumping, and Release Packaging. 

Examples:
Breaking Change -> feat(smartcloudjs)!: Adds MySQL support
Minor -> feat(workflows): 
Patch -> fix(discord): fixes loop bug #13
