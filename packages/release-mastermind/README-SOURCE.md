# Mastermind Collection

Welcome to the Github Action Mastermind collection. This is the mono-repository for Videndum's collection of superpowered actions. This collection is built to work together as an univeral tool for Github Project management. For simplisity, our main tool - Release Mastermind - incorperates all our other tools within one simple action, which can be used in all your workflows to manage all your common tasks.

We designed this tool because the community tools either didn't have the features we wanted, or are not maintained. We wanted to create a single action which could do everything, or nothing, dependent on the configuration. This tool does exactly that, you choose how much or how little you want it to do...

Need reasons to consider using Release Manager?

- Everything is configured from either JSON or YAML files found within your `.github` folder for the repository. One file = no clutter.
- Automates all common tasks within a single action - Reduce the size of your workflow files
- Actively maintained - This project is actively maintained as it's the backbone of all our projects
- Works on any repository - No permissions required, simply use a Personal Access Token

## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is **Extremely** important to understand while using this template, most of the code within `.github/` will automatically update within a new pull request whenever the [template repository](https://github.com/Videndum/Universal-GitAction-Workflows) is updated.

<!-- #include docs/readme/components/setup/automaticSetup.md -->

### Manual setup

Create a new Github Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/main.yml`:

_Note: `actions/checkout` must be run first so that the release action can find your config file._

<details>
    <summary><b>main.yml</b></summary>

<!-- #code .github/workflows/main.yml -->

</details>

Now create the config file at `.github/config.json`:

<details>
    <summary><b>Our runners config (Very Long)</b></summary>

<!-- #code .github/config/runners.json -->

</details>

Be sure that Github Actions is enabled for in your repository's settings. The action will now run on your issues, projects and pull requests.

## Final Note

Thank you for taking the time to look through this repository. If you have liked what you have found, please would you favourite & share. Ideally I would like to get a community behind this project which can ensure that it is maintained, updated and improved as GitActions get more suffisticated.

This project took heavy infulence from [IvanFon/super-labeler-action](https://github.com/IvanFon/super-labeler-action) which we are actively maintaining on our fork here: [Videndum/forked-super-labeler-action](https://github.com/Videndum/forked-super-labeler-action). We invite any of the team who worked on his project to come onboard with our version and intend to continue maintaining for a significant while.
